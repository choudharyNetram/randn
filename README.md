# Normal Distribution Generator
## Introduction

The ability to generate random numbers is essential in various computer programs. This project explores an algorithm for generating numbers from a normal distribution in Python, specifically without relying on the randn function. Instead, it employs the Box-Muller method to generate random numbers from a uniform distribution and then convert them into a normal distribution.

A solid understanding of probability theory, statistics, and computer programming is necessary to grasp the Box-Muller approach. This documentation provides insights into the underlying concepts, the development of the Box-Muller algorithm, and its application to produce normally distributed random numbers. Additionally, it discusses the limitations and constraints of this approach.


## Instructions
Run the Python script.
Input values for mu and sigma when prompted.
The script will generate 100,000 random numbers and display a histogram.
Feel free to experiment with different mu and sigma values to observe changes in the generated distribution.
